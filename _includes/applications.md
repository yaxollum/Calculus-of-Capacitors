## What are some applications of capacitors?

Capacitors are used to temporarily store energy, similar to small batteries. But unlike batteries, it can be charged and discharged rapidly, while having much less capacity. Due to its properties it is used in almost all electrical circuits. The following are some of the applications of capacitors:

### Capacitors in Camera Flashes

Typical portable cameras are powered by $$1.5V$$ batteries, which is not enough to power the camera flash that briefly turns on when the user presses the shutter button. To power the flash, a step-up circuit is used to bring the voltage of the power supplied by the battery up to around $$200V$$ and the capacitor in the camera is charged to a high voltage using the power. When the user presses on the shutter button, the capacitor is discharged instantly through the flash bulb, which produces a bright flash of light.

### Capacitors in Electric Buses

One possible application of capacitors are in electric buses. A typical capacitor's capacity would not be enough to power a bus, but a new form of capacitor, called ultracapacitors, has a much higher energy density, and is suitable for running a bus. Using a capacitor instead of a battery comes with a number of advantages such as less overall maintenance required, as batteries lose capacity after a certain amount of charging cycle. Capacitors also charge and discharge much quicker.

The driving pattern of buses is very different from cars, as buses tend to stop and start frequently. This means that the bus could be charged at bus stops every few kilometres, but it must be done very quickly. An ultracapacitor is suitable for this application, as it can be charged and discharged very quickly. The bus would be charged using induction coils under the road at each stop.

Finally, the use of capacitors would be more environmentally friendly compared to using batteries. Capacitors use less toxic materials compared to conventional Lithium-ion batteries. These batteries make use of rare earth metals such as cobalt, which are mined in countries where the mining process is often done in an unethical manner.
