## What is a capacitor?

A **capacitor** is a circuit component which stores electric potential energy. It is made up of two parallel plates: a positive plate and a negative plate. An insulator is inserted in between the plates to ensure that electrons cannot flow between the plates. The two plates have opposite charges, and the **charge** of a capacitor refers to the charge of its positive plate. Charge is measured in coulombs and represented using the symbol $$Q$$.

## How does a capacitor work?

A capacitor is charged by connecting it to a voltage source such as a battery. The positive plate gets charged with a charge of $$Q$$, and the negative plate gets charged with a charge of $$-Q$$. The charge $$Q$$ is proportional to the voltage $$V$$ which is applied across the capacitor:
\\[Q=CV\\]
The proportionality constant $$C$$ is known as the capacitorâ€™s **capacitance**. Capacitance is measured in farads, where 1 farad is equal to 1 coulomb per volt.
